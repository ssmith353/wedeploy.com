## Introduction

[Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/) is a concurrent, class-based, object-oriented language expressly designed for use in the distributed environment of the web. It is normally compiled to the binary format defined in the JVM Specification.

## Configuring

<aside>

All WeDeploy projects use similar a [configuration file](/docs/configure/the-wedeployjson/) to prepare your projects for deployment.

</aside>

Below is an examples of a `wedeploy.json` for the Java container. The `id` for your services are uniquely determined by you.

```application/json
{
  "id": "myservice",
  "memory": 2048
}
```

You need to place a `wedeploy.json` wherever you have a `build.gradle`.

```xml
myservice
├── build.gradle
└── wedeploy.json
```

##### Port

The default port exposed for Java services is `8080` ([learn more about using ports](/docs/configure/the-wedeployjson/#port)).

##### Versions

When deploying Java services, we use these versions to automatically build your services.

**Maven**

- Maven version `3.5.2`
- JDK version `8`

**Gradle**

- Gradle version `4.5`
- JDK version `8`
