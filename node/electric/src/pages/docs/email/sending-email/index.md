## Sending email

In order to send emails, we can simply make a request to the url of our service and include some required parameters like `from`, `to`, and `subject`.

```javascript
WeDeploy
  .email('<serviceID>-<projectID>.wedeploy.io')
  .auth('<your-project-master-token>')
  .from('from@domain.com')
  .to('to@domain.com')
  .subject('Hi there!')
  .message('What are your plans on Thursday?')
  .send()
  .then(function(response) {
    console.log('Email ID:', response);
  })
  .catch(function(error) {
    // Some error has happened
  });
```
```swift
WeDeploy
  .email('<serviceID>-<projectID>.wedeploy.io')
  .from(self.username)
  .to(self.username)
  .subject("subject")
  .message("body")
  .send()
  .then { id in
    print("Email ID: \(id)")
  }
  .catch { error in
    // Some error has happened
  }
```
```text/x-java
WeDeploy
  .email("<serviceID>-<projectID>.wedeploy.io/emails")
  .from("from@domain.com")
  .to("to@domain.com")
  .subject("Hi there!")
  .send()
  .execute();
```
```text/x-sh
curl -X "POST" "https://<serviceID>-<projectID>.wedeploy.io/emails" \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-project-master-token>' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d $'{
        "from": "from@domain.com",
        "to": "to@domain.com",
        "subject": "Hi there!",
        "message": "What are your plans on Thursday?"
      }'
```

As a result, we'll receive an email ID. This doesn't indicate that the email has already sent, it actually just means that it was added to the email queue. See ["checking the email status"](/docs/email/checking-status/) to learn more about email status.
