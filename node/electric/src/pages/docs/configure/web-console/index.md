## Introduction

The WeDeploy Console is a home for you to create, install, manage, configure, view logs, and check the status of your projects.

To get started, you first need to create a WeDeploy account by signing up through the [Console Signup Page](https://console.wedeploy.com/signup).

When you login to the Console, you will see a list of your WeDeploy projects. If you don't have any yet, don't worry, we will go over how to change that below.

## Create a new project

To start, you must create new project by going to the button in the top right corner named _"New Project"_. Then you can type an ID for your project. Project names are permanent and cannot be changed later.

Once your project is created, it will show up on your Console main page. To see the details of your project, click on the name of the project.

## Install a service

By clicking on a project, you can start monitoring and configuring your project and its services.

In each project, you can have up to three services installed. To install a new service, click on the _"Install Service"_ button in the top right corner of your project's Console screen.

You must choose the type of service you want to install.

##### Choose an ID

Similar to project ID's, service ID's are permanent and cannot be changed later. When you have chosen an ID, click _"Install Service"_.

## View your service live

Once your service is installed, we give you a specific URL for that service that is made up with the service and project ID's (_website-strawberry.wedeploy.io_). You can always find this URL by clicking on the service in the overview section.
